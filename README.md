# AI Resume Optimizer

## Overview

AI Resume Optimizer is an intelligent web application designed to help job seekers enhance their resumes for better chances of landing interviews. The tool analyzes uploaded resumes, provides keyword suggestions, format improvements, and ATS (Applicant Tracking System) compatibility checks based on industry best practices and job descriptions.

The app leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to tailor resumes for targeted roles effectively.

## Motivation

In competitive job markets, having a well-optimized resume is critical. Many qualified candidates miss opportunities due to poorly formatted or keyword-incompatible resumes. This project empowers users by using AI to automatically improve resume quality and relevance, making their applications stand out.
